# Gender Disparities in Weight Perception among U.S. Adults
### : A Cross-Sectional Study using NHANES 2017-2018 Data

## 1. Background
In the field of public health, accurate weight perception is a key factor in obesity management. However, there is a hypothesis that the discrepancy between actual Body Mass Index (BMI) and self-perceived weight status may vary significantly by gender due to social pressures.

## 2. Objective
This project aims to analyze the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)** data to determine whether gender influences self-perceived overweight status, even after adjusting for actual BMI and age.

## 3. Methods
* **Data Source:** NHANES 2017-2018 (CDC)
* **Population:** 5,727 U.S. Adults (Age 20+)
* **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Statsmodels
* **Statistical Analysis:** Multivariate Logistic Regression (Adjusted for Age & BMI)

## 4. Key Findings (Results)
After adjusting for age and actual BMI, the analysis revealed a significant gender disparity:
* **Women were 2.25 times more likely** to perceive themselves as overweight compared to men with the same BMI (aOR = 2.25, P < 0.001).
* **Age** was not a significant predictor of weight perception after controlling for BMI.

## 5. Conclusion
This study provides statistical evidence of **body image distortion among U.S. women**. Even when objective body mass is identical, women are significantly more likely to feel overweight, suggesting a need for gender-sensitive approaches in public health interventions.
